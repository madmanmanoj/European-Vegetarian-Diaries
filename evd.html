	<h2>My Story</h2>
	<p>Hey! I have been veggie all my life and when I decided to move to France, I was worried about my food options because it is not exactly known to be vegetarian/vegan friendly! But after living here and touring other European countries (whenever I can) for almost 1.5 years, I have managed to do well. This is why I started an Instagram page to show that itâ€™s not that difficult to be a veggie afterall in Europe!</p>

	<h2>Feel free to give food suggestions!</h2>
	<p>On this suggestions page you can suggest me which restaurant to go to in your city which will help me build up a directory of vegetarian restaurants. Feel free to give as much as information as possible like, city, landmark, and special food suggestions if any. Pass on the information to do your bit to be green.</p>
